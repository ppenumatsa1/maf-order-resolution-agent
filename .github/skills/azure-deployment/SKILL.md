# Azure Deployment Skill

Use this skill only for deployments that already passed Azure validation. Do not use it to design, prepare, or validate an unvalidated app.

## Hard gates

- Require `.azure/deployment-plan.md` to exist with status `Validated`.
- Run pre-deploy checks before any mutation: active subscription, AZD environment, required variables, Docker availability when needed, and clean authentication to Azure.
- Do not perform destructive cleanup, resource deletion, environment reset, or database drop unless the user explicitly confirms that exact destructive action.

## Deployment sequence

Default to app-only deployment for routine code changes:

```bash
azd deploy
```

Use full infra+app deployment only when infra/runtime surfaces changed:

```bash
azd provision
azd deploy
```

Use `scripts/skills/deployment-mode-router.sh` to route this decision automatically.

After `azd provision`, confirm expected resources exist and managed identities/RBAC assignments are present before deploying containers.

## Known recovery

If Container Apps deployment fails because the app is not bound to ACR through its managed identity, recover with the explicit registry binding and rerun deploy:

```bash
az containerapp registry set \
  --name <container-app-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --server <acr-login-server> \
  --identity system
azd deploy
```

Use this recovery only for the known registry binding issue; do not mask unrelated deployment failures.

## Post-deploy verification

- Run smoke tests against the live HTTPS endpoint.
- Verify health endpoint, Container Apps revision readiness, and recent logs.
- Run hosted Playwright UI parity against the live frontend:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL="<frontend-https-url>" make test-e2e
```

  Fail deployment verification if Workflow History shows `Unexpected token`, `not valid JSON`, or `<!doctype`; that means frontend routing/proxy/API base configuration is returning HTML instead of JSON.
- Validate RBAC live: ACR image pull, Key Vault secret reads, PostgreSQL connectivity, and observability ingestion where applicable.
- Validate `ORD-1001` completes without `hitl.request`.
- Validate `ORD-1009` emits `hitl.request` and completes the expected approval/resume path.
- Report the frontend HTTPS endpoint, its `/health` and proxied `/api/health`
  endpoints, and any hosted-agent smoke target. Identify the backend API FQDN
  as internal-only rather than presenting it as browser-accessible.

## Output

Report deployed environment, resource group, Container Apps names, image tags when available, smoke results, RBAC results, and fully qualified HTTPS endpoints. If deployment fails, report the exact command, error, recovery attempted, and next safe action.
